# Kubernetes cloud controller manager for Xen Orchestra

The CCM does a few things: it initialises new nodes, applies common labels to them. 

It supports multiple pools, meaning you can have one kubernetes cluster across multiple Xenorchestra pools.

The basic definitions:
* kubernetes label `topology.kubernetes.io/region` is a Xenorchestra pool `clusters[].region`
* kubernetes label `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` is an hypervisor host machine name

This makes it possible to use pods affinity/anti-affinity.

## üßê Features

Support controllers:

* cloud-node
  * Updates node resource.
  * Assigns labels and taints based on Xen Orchestra VM configuration.
* cloud-node-lifecycle
  * Cleans up node resource when Xen Orchestra VM is deleted.
*cloud-node-label-sync
  * Syncs labels from Xen Orchestra VM to Kubernetes node.

## Example

```yaml
# cloud provider config
# Url the Xen Orchestra API
url: https://xoa.example.com
insecure: false
# Token for the Xen Orchestra API
token: "123ABC"
```
